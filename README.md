### Author: Collin Paiz

### Institution: Santa Clara University

### Professor: Dr. David Anastasiu

### Session: Spring 2023

## Overview

#### This repository includes three Jupyter Notebook projects from the lecture section of COEN 140: Machine Learning & Data Mining.

## Program 1 - Text Classification

#### Develop predictive models that can determine, given short news item descriptions, which of 4 classes they fall in.

## Program 2 - Regression

#### Develop predictive models that can determine, given a large number of attributes describing a donor, how much money they are likely to donate in the next campaign.

## Program 3 - Clustering

#### For the purposes of this assignment, you will cluster EKG signals from 23 subjects captured while performing 5 different activities. Each sample represents 1 second of EKG signal and there are 500 samples for each activity performed by each subject, for a total of 11500 samples. Each sample has 178 EKG values.
